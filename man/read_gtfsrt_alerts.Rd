\description{
This function reads GTFS realtime alerts. Alerts are hierarchical:
a single alert can have multiple applicability periods, multiple
affected entities, and translations to multiple languages. This
function flattens all of that to a tabular format, with one row
for every combination of applicability, entity, and language. All
rows from a single alert can be identified through a common id.
